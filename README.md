The colours are `red`, `green`, `blue`, and `yellow`. 

### A round 
- In turn each player plays a card to see who wins.
- The winner keeps their own card in their winnings pile.
- First to obtain cards of 3 _different_ elements or 3 cards of the _same_ colour wins the game
- The starting player is chosen at random (dice rolls/draw cards).

### Winning a round
